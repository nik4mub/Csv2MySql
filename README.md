```

## Running the Program
1. Open a command line terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python csv2Mysql.py
   ```
4. When prompted, enter the CSV file name (including the `.csv` extension).

## Notes
- Errors may occur if:
  - The file is not found.
  - The data cannot be processed.
